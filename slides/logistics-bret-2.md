## Setup: log into your servers, then chill out

- Create three instances (we'll do most work on node1)

- Copy your unique play-with-docker browser URL
  - Use it to reopen your session in case you close your browser
  - You can share this URL with someone else (eg. TA's to help you debug)

- Enjoy some of Bret's favorite jams while we get this party started!

- You could also browse my Docker resources [bretfisher.com/docker](https://www.bretfisher.com/docker)
