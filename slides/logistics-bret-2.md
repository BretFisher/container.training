## Swarm Orchestration - Features and Workflows

### Setup: install ssh, test connection, chill out

- You'll get 3 servers via a piece of paper, they are your unique IP's

- Today we use a set of AWS EC2 instances, so make sure you have ssh installed

- Test ssh with `ssh docker@<your server ips>`

- Enjoy some classic rock while we get this party started!
